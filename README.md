### DISCLAIMER

Please make sure that you consider copyrights and trademarks when you use names or logos of a company and add a disclaimer to your README.
You can check other adapters for examples or ask in the developer community. Using a name or logo of a company without permission may cause legal problems for you.


### Writing tests
When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the 
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when 
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development 
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92. 
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very 
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.
